Goldman Sachs | Coderpad | Find the largest tree - https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1837497/goldman-sachs-coderpad-find-the-largest-tree

== Instructions ==

Given a forest (one or more disconnected trees), find the root of largest tree and return its Id. If there are multiple such roots, return the smallest Id of them.

Complete the largestTree function in the editor below.
It has one parameter, immediateParent, which is a map containing key-value pair indicating child -> parent relationship. The key is child and value is the corresponding immediate parent.

Constraints
- Child cannot have more than one immediate parent
- Parent can have more than one immediate child
- The given key-value pair formes a well-forest (a tree of n nodes will have n-1 edges)

Example:

Input: { {1 -> 2}, {3 -> 4} }

Expected output: 2

Explanation: There are two trees one having root of Id 2 and another having root of Id 4.
Both trees have size 2. The smaller number of 2 and 4 is 2. Hence the answer is 2.
